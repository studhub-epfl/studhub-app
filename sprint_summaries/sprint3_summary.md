# Summary for sprint 3

## Samuel _(Scrum Master)_
As advised and as expected, this sprint has been very difficult to manage consistently during the extended period.  I personally had to focus on some subjects that would have decided my definitive echec in this school and my future, and I had to put them as priorities by sacrificing a lot of time that I wanted to give for this sprint.  As far as tasks and tests are concerned I still managed to do what I expected, however I honestly spent more time dealing with the group assignments than the actual work, which is a shame as it was the wrong week for me in which to be scrum master.  In spite of myself, I take my responsibilities for that.



## Edouard **W**
During this sprint, I focused on implementing two internal systems within the project: the Blocking system and the Report system. The Blocking system included implementing a search function for items that have been blocked by users, as well as implementing a messaging system for blocking. The Report system involved implementing functionalities for reporting both content and user behavior. Although the tasks were large and took more time than expected, I was able to successfully complete them and enhance the functionality of the project. Through this sprint, I gained valuable experience in developing internal systems and handling complex tasks.


## Edouard **M** 
During this sprint I unfortunately could not implement all my tasks due to lack of time because of other courses I had to catch up in.
I mainly focused on the authentication part which now works with email/password. Only EPFL and UNIL email addresses can be used which was one of the first user story we had. The possibility to change the password was also implemented.



## Julien

This sprint wasn't one where I could take the time to work on the project as I wished to. There were midterms during the first week of the sprint and the holidays where I fell sick and needed to study a lot for another midterm that happened on the week after the break. I tried to do as much as I could last minute. At least the team knew about it so it's not like I hid the fact I couldn't output the necessary work this sprint. I'll be able to do better on the coming ones.



## Raymond

This sprint I focused on creating from scratch a Ratings view where users can add a rating on every seller's page. Every user has his own rating view where he gets rated at most once by every user who has the choice of a thumbs up or thumbs down with an existing comment and the ability to edit and remove a comment that the current user wrote. There are a few hurdles I encountered since implementing this core feature implies heavy interaction with the database and UI dialogs in relation with user input and fetching, which is why there remains some inconsistencies in the code that needs to be addressed in the future sprint as separate tasks, since this main feature cannot be fully encompassed in one task. The google meeting point implementation will also be delegated to the next sprint. 



## Overall team

We did some improvement and managed to do some of the Tasks assigned, some tasks have been delegated since they took more time than expected, other tasks were easier and we managed to finish them.

Concerning the time estimation, obviously each one of us have spent at least the hours requested for each member.

The midterms that a good chunk of this group had, was a priority unfortunately, and although some of us managed to do the stuffs in time, others had to prioritize their future over this sprint, which is very  .

We expect a big improvement from the next ones since midterms are finished and we can come back working on continuity, exactly as we were doing from the beginning
