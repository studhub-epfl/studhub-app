# Summary for sprint 5

## Samuel

For some reason, this sprint took me 20 hours or more, we had to wait and handle some issues
regarding the CI that lea us to complications, but overall I managed to do my tasks. Like in the
last sprint, I also tried to do more insight code reviews and coding.
Now categories are added on firebase and can be retrieved without any problem, also,
subCategories have a new “parentId” to create a reasonable tree for each category and
subCategory.
Moreover, price range and searchBar are adapted so that by filling all the gap in once (the first
time) you can search for any condition you want (for example a certain description in a certain
price range) with the modified tests.
I am pretty happy about my job personally, the only thing is that is taking me more time than
expected, and I’m now leaving behind other subjects.


## Edouard **W** _(Scrum Master)_

During this sprint, I focused on implementing the frontend of the Blocking system, ensuring its functionality was successfully integrated into the project. 
I also made progress on the backend of the bidding feature, although it is not yet fully implemented. 
As for the frontend of the report feature, I decided not to implement it after realizing its limited utility due to the absence of administrators to receive the reports. 
Given this realization, I prioritized other tasks that were more essential and needed for the project. Additionally, as the Scrum Master, 
I dedicated time to checking the testing process and ensuring the team is well-prepared for finishing the important last-minute tasks.
Although my code contribution may not be substantial this time, I focused on fostering team readiness and facilitating the overall progress of the sprint.


## Edouard **M** 

During this sprint I mainly focused on cache requirements, implementing caching of conversations/messages, favorite listings and user profile. I also implemented syncing of unsent messages when back online but I unforunately could not finish my last task in time which was to offer the possibility to locally save/cache listing drafts.
I also made it possible for users to have direct access to all the listing they published from the profile screen (display own listings button).
Last but certainly not least, I also worked on fixing the continuous integration which was failing for strange reasons (unrelated to our test suite). Now everything works fine.


## Julien

This sprint I worked on coverage and implementing tasks to help add the bidding feature to the app. This end of semester is so full of projects that have deadlines all at the same time making it extremely difficult 
to keep the pace with SDP and I'll have to admit that fighting with the CI situation we had for a while was extremely frustrating and left me quite 
unmotivated after losing so many hours for stuff that had no participation towards the app's progress. 
I am doing as much as possible but despite spending the recommended working on the sprint, I struggle to clear all my tasks because of all these hiccups.


## Raymond

In this Sprint I focused on improving the test coverage of the overall project, since a deadline was set which threatened failure in the context of 'surprise requirements' taken out of a Hunger Game script. 
I also continued work on the previous huge tasks, maps and ratings, which were not taken account in my grade for the last sprint because they were not merged in time. 
Naturally, since they were not taken into account last sprint, they will be taken into account this sprint, along with all the hours they took to implement. The notifications task will be relayed to next sprint because of all this work, 
and because it requires a complex implementation, and my peers didn't complete their bidding implementation at the time of writing (Thursday Night) which naturally means the notification system will be delayed for next sprint. Thank you for reading.


## Overall team

We implemented almost all of the user stories we had assigned to this sprint, especially the most important ones.
Our time estimates are getting better. Testing took a lot of time and fixing cirrus problem was a nightmare.
On a good note we managed to pump the test coverage up to 67%.
