**Julien Jordan** _Scrum master_  

I learned quite a bit as a scrum master this sprint and I hope the whole team gained experience from it. It was at times a little chaotic due to being the very first sprint of the project
and without much surprises we spent a lot more time than planned working on the project. It was a great experience but all the more stressful when you overestimate the work to do by that much.
I also realised the importance of being very clear with the tasks given as it was quite common to clarify what should or should not be done with each member about each tasks. Planning meetings and making sure everyone is doing their task was at times stressful.
As for myself I went through a lot of learning with Jetpack Compose and using material 3 to create many smaller composables for the UI as well as views to create a user and create a listing. I took on the additional task of creating a primitive browse page.
I did stay working overnight a few times to make sure we could have things done on time and especially to do our best providing with a demo as complete as possible towards our sprint goals and to take on the responsibility as a scrum master for the overestimation of the team.
I am happy though that everyone went out of their way to do their best and work a lot this sprint and it constitutes now a solid base to progress with this project despite the difficulties we had, notably with the time left to create tests.

During this sprint, I focused on refactoring the base of the project to work on Kotlin Jetpack Compose and adding some basic screens. I also prioritized improving the test coverage of the project.
Although I encountered some difficulties in getting familiar with Compose, I persisted and gained more confidence over time. Overall, I was able to successfully complete my tasks.

I made a first attempt at implementing a color theme for our app, it took some familiarizing with Jetpack Compose modularity. This will surely be reviewed in the following weeks following suggestions of colleagues and potential customers.
I set up the skeleton of our UI : Home screen with buttons to browse items, sell an item, access the cart, and an about screen [ skeleton -> the views aren't filled with their functionalities yet. ]
I also added a basic detailed listing view with a placeholder image. [what you see when you click on an item]. Test coverage jumped to 86% at the end of my working on the UI.

During this first sprint I mainly focused on implementing features in the data and domain layers. I worked closely with Sam as our tasks were related most of the time. We (with Sam), implemented internal components such as the methods that will be used in the view to retrieve or store models (user, listing, category, etc...). I also did a little bit of project configuration (cirrus and other github workflows). I finished by implementing the login system and some automatic dependency injection.
Of course it all started by reading a lot of documentation on Kotlin (which was new to me) and Android (also new).
All in all I think that we globally have a nice code structure/architecture and that we had a hard but good start so I am happy about it.

The first sprint took long enough to complete each task. The project probably seems to have a graphic and internal aspect increasingly inclined to the
one sought. Based on the models implemented, I first created the reference
categories for the app of exchange we are working on, with an id for each different category and its description. Later I connected the firebase features to
the listings linked by category, using in kotlin those that we studied in java as
”Completable Futures” in the Software Engineering course.
