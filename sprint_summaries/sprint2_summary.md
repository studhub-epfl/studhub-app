# Summary for sprint 2

## Samuel

This sprint was a “sprint” in the real sense of the name.  We’re on the right path.  The team seems cohesive and there is good communication, in general the tasks are interconnected but the functionalities manage to remain separate.  I created a 'search bar' as in all exchange applications to be able to search for specific items by description or name.  The functionality is clearly adapted to be linked to firebase, its database and google authentication.  Time spent was closer to truthful (compared to last time which took more than normal).


## Edouard **W**

During this sprint, I focused on implementing the Favorite system within the project.
This involved implementing internal functionalities to add and remove a listing as a favorite and retrieve the list of favorite listings, adding the favorite feature to the listing view, and creating a view that displays the current user's favorite items. I also made sure to maintain a test diff coverage of above 80% for my branches.
Although I encountered some difficulties in getting familiar with writing backend database code, I was able to improve my skills and gain valuable experience. However, the time spent on this sprint was higher than expected, likely due to the learning curve associated with the new feature. Despite this, I was able to successfully complete my tasks.


## Edouard **M** _(Scrum Master)_

This sprint I managed to do all my task except one that I could not totally finish which was the least important one and did not concern any new functionality.
I also had to take some additional tasks which some of my mates did not have time for.
As a scrum master I also had to help my colleagues when they were stuck, which I think I did a good job at.


## Julien

This sprint I've been very busy first week so I have done the bulk of the work later on. I've worked on implementing a nice task bar and made the browse page show actual listings. I also refactored a lot of code, a lot of which wasn't quite asked in my task but I believe it was necessary as it made my work easier and will probably help others in the team. I also tried my best with tests and more precisely implemented a custom annotation that would remove previews function from the coverage helping everyone more closely match the coverage threshold.
Communication with the team is good as usual despite answer times taking some waiting sometimes. I wished some of us would do better when refactoring stuff to not make things worse than they were and I also hoped I'd have done a better job at testing stuff overall. Time taken to do my tasks more closely matched reality this time.


## Raymond

In this sprint I focused on refactoring the whole project structure into a Screen/Viewmodel architecture. I had trouble implementing tests with Hilt dependency injections and overcame it with the help of the scrum master. I alao implemented a discussion view (Chat view) between two users. Due to me underestimating the time to refactor the project, I was unable to complete a third task which was assigned to me.


## Overall team

We implemented almost all of the user stories we had assigned to this sprint but could not complete all of them in time.

Our time estimates are getting better even though we still need to work on that part.

Most of us had to focus on other courses which made the team fall behind the planning by quite a good amount of time.

On a good note we managed to pump the test coverage up to 73% (up by 42%) before having to rapidly merge some late, untested changes.
