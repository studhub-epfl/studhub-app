# Summary for sprint 4

## Raymond (Scrum Master)

This sprint I fully implemented the Ratings system with testing. It is functional, efficient, 
and its UI sleek. I also fully implemented the Meeting Point system implementation which is a requirement 
(Google Maps) with. I encountered a lot of hurdles setting up the API key, especially because the professor's 
proposed method to bypass billing didn't work which caused a lot of errors when I thought the API was activated. 
I didn't implement testing for the Meeting Point system. because it is rests 100% on Geocoder's correct functioning 
and doesn't have a screen in and of itself which test tags that I could evaluate . Besides these 2 main feature implementations,
 I patched negative phone prices and enforced correct phone number formats,

## Edouard **W**

During this sprint, I focused on implementing several features within the project. Firstly, I implemented the entire ]
backend and frontend of the Blocking internal system, but the frontend is still in PR due to a minor bug. Additionally, 
I successfully implemented the full functional frontend of the Report internal system. Finally, I also implemented the
 full functional frontend of the Favorite feature. Although the tasks were large and took more time than expected,
 I was able to successfully complete them and enhance the functionality of the project. Through this sprint,
 I gained valuable experience in developing complex features and troubleshooting issues.
## Edouard **M** _(Scrum Master)_

During this sprint I worked on two different parts of the app. The first one being the messaging system which
 is now fully functionnal, updates in real-time and is not painful to look at. The second one is everything that concerns pictures,
 "everything" being the profile picture and pictures for listings. During my free time I also did some cleaning, like when I removed
 Google One-Tap Sign-In. I also helped my teammates with some parts of their tasks. Even though the coverage on the last part of my job
 was unsufficient, I could finish all my issues in time.


## Julien

This sprint I was able to do all my tasks, I made the application more robust in usage for some part and was able to do some testing. 
Overall I am happy with my implementations and I believe we made good progress in making the application a lot more usable after looking 
at the feedback from sprint 2. I wanted to do more testing but I couldn't find the time for that. I had to help nearly all members 
of the team for various reasons and I had to spend a very long time doing reviews as it was urgent for PRs to go through and finish
 the sprint so it impacted a lot my ability to spend time on my own tasks.

## Overall team

We are proud of the comeback we made in implementing core features (maps, ratings, favorites, blocking, messages, photos, quality of life).
Test coverage was not improved overall but was not impacted by the new features (a lot of tests added, a lot of tests ommitted.)
